# faceit-players-stats
Python program to get player's matches and their stats from FaceIt. Made by using the official FaceIt API.

https://developers.faceit.com/docs/tools/data-api

Usage:
- get FaceIt API_KEY from Faceit Developers Portal
- add API_KEY to main.py and replace player by desired FaceIt username
- run main.py to generate a JSON file (example included in the repo)

Notebook file shows some example analysis. For example, I've mapped the player's average stats given a specific teammate in their team.
